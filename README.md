# Lorenz-Attractor

This is a visual simulation of lorenz system of ordinary differential equation showcasing the "Butterfly Effect" (i.e. a small change in one state of a deterministic non-linear system can result in large differences in a later state). This was implemented using JavaScript p5.js library.
